/**
 * One DTO for both the list and the detail route (unlike `jobs`, which splits
 * card/detail) — `WorkshopsSection`'s card and `WorkshopPage` read from the
 * same client-side `Workshop` object, so splitting would only force the page
 * to re-fetch what the catalogue already had.
 *
 * Deliberately absent, and why:
 *  - `id` — `slug` is the public identifier on every route (mirrors `jobs`).
 *  - `format` — pure i18n chrome derived from `weeks` + `spotsTotal`
 *    (`addWorkshop.build.ts` composes it with `t(...)`); the API ships the
 *    inputs instead.
 *  - `added` — the frontend's "New" badge. Every row here is member-posted, so
 *    a stored flag would be permanently `true`; `createdAt` lets the client
 *    decide what counts as new.
